# Eastvantage Addresses details
 - It is a small, simple and robust framework for creating, updating, deleting and finding the distance between two 
   or more addresses.
 - It is only backend API details that we can easily access by Swagger Doc page or other API testing platform like 
   Postman etc.
 - It will automatically create the Log Folder where framework can store the logging details at the path where our 
   framework will run.
